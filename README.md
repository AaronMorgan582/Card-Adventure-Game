# Card-Adventure-Game
A small "adventure" game made in Python using Pygame

This is the repository that holds the code and the images for a small game that was made by Aaron Morgan and Bridger Smith, for Professor David Johnson's COMP 1010 class at the University of Utah.

You play as the 2 of Diamonds, who searches for the rest of their suit (the rest of the Diamonds), in an area that is intended to be a casino. The game is won when the rest of the Diamond cards are found.

It's all done in pixel art, which was created by Bridger and myself. 

The code isn't particularly written or organized well, as I was still fairly new to programming, as was Bridger (who also wasn't a CS student).
